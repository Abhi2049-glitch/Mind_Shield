# Mind_Shield
MindShield is an AI-powered Chrome Extension that acts as a "Cognitive Firewall" for your browser. Instead of just blocking bad URLs, it uses Google Gemini 2.0 to detect psychological manipulation—like Urgency, Fear, and False Authority—and highlights these triggers in real-time directly on the webpage.
